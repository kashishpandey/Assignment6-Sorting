Assignment #6: Sorting

Errors:
No known errors

Source files:
Sorter.h
Sorter.cpp
main.cpp
Makefile
nums.txt // file already with numbers in it
genNumbers.txt // randomly generated file
pandeyA6writeup.pdf

Other:
To generate a file run: ./assignment6.exe genNumbers.txt
Line 1 of the file should be the total number of doubles you would like to generate
In main switch 'size': s-> sampleFile(size); to the desired number as well
To run a normal file with doubles already given just enter the text file name after ./assignment6.exe

How this program compiles:

make
./assignment6.exe

or

g++ *.cpp
./a.out nums.txt (or whatever text file you would like to enter)
